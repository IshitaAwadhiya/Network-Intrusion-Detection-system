# Network-Intrusion-Detection-system

 Designed and developed a real-time network intrusion detection system by capturing live
 network traffic using Wireshark and TShark. 
 
Processed packet data to extract relevant features and trained an advanced ensemble learning
 model (Random Forest + XGBoost) for accurate intrusion classification.
 
 Built a Flask-based backend API for real-time detection and integrated a database to log
 intrusion events.
 
 Also created a React.js dashboard for live monitoring of network security alerts. Focused on
 real-time detection, low latency, and high model accuracy to enhance network defense
 mechanisms.
